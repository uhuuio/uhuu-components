Static pagination maintains precise control over the document layout.

**Use Case**: Structured layouts like catalogs, brochures, and contracts.

### **Dynamic Pagination**
Automatically flows content across pages, adding or removing pages as needed.  
Dynamic pagination is ideal for handling variable-length content.

**Use Case**: Reports, invoices, or newsletters where content size changes dynamically.

### **Image Spread**
Covers two facing pages with a single image for high-impact visuals.  
Adds bleed to ensure proper alignment after cutting and binding.
